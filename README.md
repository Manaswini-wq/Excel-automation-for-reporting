**Problem:** Reduce manual effort and errors in weekly reporting.

**Tools:** Microsoft Excel (Advanced Formulas, VBA, Pivot Tables)

**What I Did:**
- Automated report generation using advanced Excel formulas.

- Developed VBA macros to refresh data and streamline workflows.
- Reduced report preparation time by 60%.
- Increased accuracy and consistency of business reports.
